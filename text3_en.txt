Welcome to Sori Nori podcast. Today I’m here with Brian Junker-Lakota from the US. He is both a great singer and a great guitar player. I have heard mostly he is singing the irish and country music which is really one of my favorite music styles. 
Hi Brian, thanks for being here today with me.

Hello Ali, pleasure to be here.
<b>
I want to start to know in the states how many chances are there for children to learn music and instruments?
</b>
I think it really depends on what type of situations you grew up in. Maybe I could just talk about the way I experienced it. That was that we do have a music program in the school. Especially in the elementary school I started playing the recorder which is a sort of plastic flute with six holes on it. They taught all of us the basics of what is a quarter note and what is a half note, and what is a rest and how to read the basic music sheets. Up to age 11 everyone should take this course and after that it is optional. 
<b>
When you are talking about the music in elementary school or after, does it mean classical music, country music or what exactly  kind of music? 
</b>
I wouldn’t say it means classical or country music. First of all it is music theory. Like I said we started with the recorder and by playing “Mary had a little lamb” and “Row row row your boat”, you know, typical music pieces that everyone knows and it is just about teaching the children what rhythm is and what scale of seven notes is.
<b>
How did you become interested in folk songs, country music, and irish songs?
</b>
That is a good question. I would say through my heritage. So my mother is irish canadian. My grandparents are irish. I have always heard irish songs now and again. I always liked the kind of story-telling nature of them for one but also they are just really fun songs and the american country music was also influenced by these irish music as all the immigrants came in the end of 1800 and early 1900. So, they are two related genres.
<b>
Yeah. I agree. So, it could be something that influenced your music style and preferences.
</b>
You mean being exposed to the irish music. 
<b>
Yes. Exactly from your mother's side.
</b>
Yes, I think it definitely did. I always listened to a variety of music, you know rock and pop, and actually started with the music from 60 and 70 from my father, but I think the irish music certainly influenced my taste in what I like to play myself. 
<b>
I can see. So, You told me once that you also studied opera singing. How was this experience of studying opera singing because it is special and how did you get into this direction?
</b>
That is a very good question because I got started in opera singing by playing the guitar. I was in a boy scout camp and some people had guitars and I thought it was super cool and the next summer I came with my own guitar and learned it. I also started to write songs. But you know as I was playing my songs from my bedroom my mother was listening to me and she told me I need voice lessons. You can say it is positive or negative but anyway she got me to a voice teacher which very much improved my singing voice and he was a classically trained singer and got me interested in classical and musical directions, like musical theater. 
<b>
Can it be that after this you started to listen to more classical music? 
</b>
Definitely. I never was a real avid classic music listener. I got introduced to classical music through my music teacher and really got into it about two years ago when I was studying opera at the University of Miami. 
<b>
So, maybe for our listeners it is interesting to know what kinds of music you listen to personally. You can tell me some names from any types of music you listen to. 
</b>
Sure, I really like acoustic rock and I also like traditional music. So, there is one acoustic rock singer. He actually just came out with a new album. His artist name is bright eyes. He got a very story-telling kind of songwriting which I really like. Maybe that is what I really like the most because I also like Hank William in the country direction for example. He is very famous, maybe 95 or 96, I would say, an old country singer. They both have this kind of story-telling aspect. 
<b>
Interesting. Do you listen to any classical music?
</b>
I do listen to classical music. I put it on in my Alexa. I ask them to play some classical music for me. I really like opera. I used to go more often to opera in Berlin which we have this staatsopera, the great institution. And in the classical direction, I mostly like romantic operas like Puccini. 
<b>
You might have heard “Turandot” from Puccini. This is my favorite. 
</b>
Yeah, that is a great one. 
<b>
Great. Getting to a different direction. As I know you speak Spanish and German very well too, do you listen to spanish or german music too? Or even you might sing in these languages?
</b>
Yes, I can sing in these languages. My first foreign language was spanish and there are a lot of good spanish songs out there, obviously there are a lot of salsa music. I really discovered a lot of them when I went to spain. They have a lot more rock and kinds of flamenco music. I sang in spanish before. I think it really helps to learn the pronunciation of the language because you focus on the music and the note and you get lots of consciousness about pronouncing the words. 
<b>
Exactly. Can you also play flamenco guitar? 
</b>
No, I can’t. I would love to but it needs a lot of work. 
<b>
Great. What was the most memorable experience in your musical career?
</b>
That is an interesting question. That was a lot of fun. We got together and played together in a music group. You know those are maybe collectively my favorite experiences musically when you just get together with people who appreciate music and they are also ideally making music with you. I had a irish folk concert in an irish pub last year and I had passed out sing-along sheets at this concert and it worked out very well because that is important to me, the experience of it and a lot of people were drinking beer and singing along the song.
<b>
Yes, I can see. Just a short question. Is it correct that these irish songs should be sung together with different people, like someone sings and plays the guitar and people sing along. 
</b>
Yes. In the ireland, there is a big culture of the session and even in Germany where I lived there is a lot of irish sessions out there where there are five and six musicians sitting at the table and one by one they each play a song and others improvise to the song if they know the lyrics. Something interesting about folk music is that there is a firm repertoire of fifty or hundred songs that everyone knows the lyrics to. It is a very friendly event. 
<b>
How do you think you could manage your music career beside your job as a computational linguist?
</b>
It can maybe be difficult to put both under one hat but one of the good things about irish music and folk music and also one of my reasons for me to specialize in this music among others is that it is fairy easy to get some of these songs down pretty well. They tend to be somehow similar in the chord structures and there are just easy songs. That is just why they are so singable. I built a repertoire over the years but it is pretty easy to prepare for a concert. I play a couple of times a week. Before the concert, I play more frequently. It is just anyone else going to a bar except I go with my guitar and get free beer.
<b>
Yes, exactly. You are right. This kind of music can be something you do besides other things. If you want to play classical music you might need more practice. So, actually, for my last question, I like to know your future dreams and something you want to do in the following five years?
</b>
Yeah. I have been playing solo for the past five years because it is a lot easier to coordinate obviously. You do not have any other players to practice with but I would really like to find some other singers to play and sing with to get some nice harmonies down. It is kind of hard to find singers for some reasons but that would be really great, maybe a singer that can play a drum alongside, you know the wooden drum like a box. Maybe someone who can play the tambourine is also good for the mood at the stage; it makes people happier to see two people on the stage. It is easier to motivate people.
<b>
Yes, I understand. I think once you had a concert you sang with your colleague. I also saw a video of it and it was very interesting. Great, I really liked this interview and I will put some of your music in the end of the podcast. Thank you Brian.
